  "summary": "The snake game MVP implementation is well-structured with proper architecture and comprehensive functionality. Found 5 minor issues: a typo in event enum, missing type imports, duplicate method definition, potential performance bottleneck in grid empty cell search, and a rendering color format inconsistency. Overall good code quality with modular design.",
