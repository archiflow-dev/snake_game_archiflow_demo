# Pull Request: Fix NameError and Complete Hexagonal Snake Game Implementation

## Summary
This PR resolves the `NameError: name 'Snake' is not defined` that occurred when running `hex_main.py`, and completes a comprehensive implementation of a hexagonal snake game across multiple development phases. The original error was triggered in `src\entities\hex_snake.py` at line 8 when attempting to inherit from the undefined `Snake` class.

## Changes
This PR includes extensive modifications across the following file categories:
- Core game logic and controllers (hex_game.py, phase3_game.py)
- Entity implementations for hexagonal grids (hex_snake.py, hex_snake_enhanced.py, hex_snake_animated.py, hex_snake_simple.py)
- Grid systems for hexagonal layouts (hex_grid.py, hexagonal.py)
- Rendering systems for hex grids (hex_renderer.py, hex_renderer_new.py, hex_renderer_phase4.py)
- AI implementations (ai_snake.py, behavior.py, pathfinding.py)
- Data persistence features (leaderboard.py, replay.py)
- Utility modules for animations, difficulty, and customization
- Comprehensive test suites for all major components
- Documentation and quick start guides

## Implementation Details

### Error Resolution
The main `NameError` was resolved by ensuring proper inheritance chain in the hexagonal snake implementations:
- Fixed import statements in `src\entities\hex_snake.py` to correctly reference the base `Snake` class
- Established clear inheritance hierarchy from base snake implementations to hexagonal variants

### Phase-wise Development
1. **Phase 2**: Initial hexagonal grid implementation with basic game mechanics
2. **Phase 3**: Enhanced with AI opponents, data persistence (leaderboards/replays), and UI improvements
3. **Phase 4**: Added animations, customization options, and performance optimizations

### Key Components Implemented
- Multiple hexagonal grid renderers optimized for different use cases
- Enhanced snake entities with animation support
- AI system with pathfinding and behavioral patterns
- Data layer for persistent game state
- Comprehensive input handling for hexagonal movement
- Modular difficulty and customization systems

## Testing
The implementation includes thorough testing across:
- Unit tests for grid systems (`test_hex_grid.py`)
- Input handling validation (`test_hex_input.py`)
- Animation and difficulty systems (`test_animation.py`, `test_difficulty.py`)
- Integration tests for game phases (`test_phase3.py`, `test_phase4.py`)
- Manual testing scripts for validation (`test_final_fix.py`, `test_restart_fix.py`)
- Quickstart implementations for verification (`test_mvp.py`, `phase4_main_final.py`)

All test files are included in the changes list, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the new hexagonal game mechanics and systems.
