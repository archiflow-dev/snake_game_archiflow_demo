## Implementation Details

### Phase 3 Features
1. **AI System Implementation**
   - Implemented behavior trees for snake AI decision making
   - Added pathfinding algorithms for optimal food collection
   - Created AI-controlled snake entities with configurable difficulty
   - Developed multi-snake interaction system for competitive play

2. **Data Persistence Layer**
   - Leaderboard system with sorting and persistence
   - Replay system to record and playback game sessions
   - Data serialization and deserialization utilities

3. **Enhanced Game Mechanics**
   - New Phase 3 game controller integrating all systems
   - Customizable difficulty settings
   - Advanced animation system for smoother gameplay
   - UI enhancements for Phase 3 features

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Updated project dependencies and build configuration
- Enhanced hexagonal grid implementation with improved performance
- Upgraded rendering system with better visual feedback
- Improved testing coverage with new test cases

## Testing

Comprehensive testing was implemented to ensure Phase 3 functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Core AI behavior and pathfinding algorithms
   - Data persistence (leaderboard and replay systems)
   - Enhanced hexagonal grid mechanics
   - Animation and difficulty systems

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Phase 3 game flow with AI opponents
   - Data persistence across game sessions
   - Multi-snake interaction scenarios

3. **Stability Testing**
   - Multiple fix iterations addressing edge cases
   - Performance testing with complex scenarios
   - Memory and resource usage validation

4. **Test Execution Scripts**
   - Created dedicated test runners for Phase 3 validation
   - Added disable_replays.py for isolated testing
   - Implemented quick test suites for rapid validation

The implementation follows the design documentation from the docs\ and docs\architecture\ directories as requested, successfully delivering a complete Phase 3 implementation with additional Phase 4 enhancements.
