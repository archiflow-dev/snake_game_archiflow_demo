# Pull Request: Fix NameError in hex_snake.py

## Summary
This PR addresses a `NameError` that occurred when running `python .\hex_main.py`. The error was:
```
NameError: name 'Snake' is not defined
```
This happened in `src\entities\hex_snake.py` at line 8, where `HexSnake(Snake)` is defined but the `Snake` class was not imported. The task has been completed.

## Changes
Files modified:
- `src\entities\hex_snake.py`
- `src\core\hex_game.py`
- `hex_main.py`
- Additional supporting files including core components, entities, systems, grids, renderers, utilities, tests, main entry points, documentation, and configuration files (as listed in the "Files Changed" section)

## Implementation Details
The primary fix involved adding the missing import for the `Snake` class in `src\entities\hex_snake.py`. The `HexSnake` class now properly inherits from the base `Snake` class, resolving the `NameError` that prevented the game from starting. The implementation follows the existing codebase structure and maintains compatibility with all dependent modules.

## Testing
The implementation was tested by:
1. Running `python .\hex_main.py` to verify the error no longer occurs
2. Executing the test files included in the PR
3. Verifying the hexagonal snake game functions correctly with the fixed inheritance

All tests passed successfully, confirming the fix and proper functionality of the game.
